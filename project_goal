Goal:
Develop a model that accurately predicts sales for six different bakery product categories: Bread, Rolls, Croissants, Confectionery, Cakes, and Seasonal Bread

Dataset:
Containing sales records from July 1, 2013, to July 30, 2018, encompassing various factors influencing bakery sales.

1. Data-Preparation & Visualization
2. Baseline linear regression model
3. Evolve your approach to incorporate more complex machine learning or neural network methods for refined predictions


Additional variables:
seasonal variations, changing consumer preferences, and the introduction of new products


Metric:
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (A lower MAPE value indicates better predictive accuracy of the model)
